# Neume Note

Neume Note is a minimal note-taking engine designed to enhance your note-taking experience using the power of ChatGPT. With features like smart complete and smart search, Neume Note transforms your workflow, making note-taking more efficient and intuitive.

## Features

### Smart Complete
Triggered in the editor, Smart Complete intelligently infers from the context of your text to generate and complete text. This feature works seamlessly within any part of your text, offering real-time, context-aware suggestions to speed up your note-taking process.

### Smart Search
Initiated from the search bar, Smart Search revolutionizes how you find information in your notes. By accepting natural language queries, it displays relevant sections from your notes that match the query. Clicking on these sections reveals the full notes, allowing you to navigate through your notes via an automatically generated network of related information.

## Installation

Neume Note is a front-end application that runs directly in your web browser, leveraging the client's browser for data storage. The application communicates with OpenAI's API using the user's API key to provide its intelligent features.

### Setup
